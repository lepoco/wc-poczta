Integration of self pickup in the Polish Post offices, Orlen, Żabka, Ruch stores and others.

== Description ==

Extend the shipping options in your store with Poczta Polska and Paczkomaty. Interactive maps are available for both shipping methods, from which the customer can choose a pickup point. The plugin does not require API keys for any provider. No registration is needed either.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress version 5.0.0 or greater (WordPress 5.5.0 or greater is recommended)
* WooCommerce version 3.4.0 or greater (WooCommerce 4.4.1 or greater is recommended)

= Automatic installation =
Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of our plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Self pickup in Poczta, Żabka, Ruch with WooCommerce” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =
The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =
Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Are there any hidden paid options? =
No. The plugin is completely free and designed according to the idea of open software.

= Do I need to log in somewhere? =
No. The plugin works exclusively on your site and does not require logging into any API. We, as creators, also do not require you to log in through our services.

= Do I have to enable all pickup points? =
In the plugin settings, you can choose which pickup points are enabled.

= Can the plug detect the weight of the shipped products? =
The plug has a built-in protection against too heavy packages. Most points allow packages up to a maximum of 20kg, and these are the default limits.

= Is this an official plugin? =
No. The plugin was created by a Polish development team based on the official documentation.
